- Initialization seems to matter quite a bit:
  
  c4large - Iteration 1880: -22416.917113308347
  c4xlarge - Iteration 1831: -3145.709649234484

- I don't see gains from using c4.xlarge. It looks like c4.large makes most sense for this sort of experiment.

- To show behavior on remotely fitted parameters, try this:

  logistician sync
  logistician run --data_readonly "./data/--optimize" -o "--behavior"
  logistician run --data_readonly "./data/--optimize" -o "--loglikelihood-train"
